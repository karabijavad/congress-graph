note: this only works on jruby, as it uses the http://github.com/karabijavad/cadet gem, which accesses the neo4j java api.

```
./bootstrap.sh
./run.sh
neo4j-community-2.3.0-M02/bin/neo4j start
```

then, try these queries out:

returns state name, gender name, number of those genders which have served a term for that state
```
MATCH (s:State)<-[:represents]-(t:Term)<-[:term]-(l:Legislator)-[:gender]->(g:Gender)
RETURN s.name, g.name, count(g) as count order by count desc
```

returns party name, religion name, number of legislators which are of that religion and in that party
```
MATCH (p:Party)<-[:party]-(t:Term)<-[:term]-(l:Legislator)-[:religion]->(r:Religion)
RETURN p.name, r.name, count(r) as count order by count desc
```

bills are related to legislators
```
(:Legislator)<-[:sponsor]-(:Bill)-[:cosponsor]->(:Legislator)
```

what subjects are each religion most sponsoring?
```
neo4j-sh (?)$ MATCH (r:Religion) WITH r MATCH r<-[:religion]-()<-[:sponsor]-(b)-[:subject]->(s) RETURN r.name, s.name, count(s.name) AS score ORDER BY score desc LIMIT 25;
